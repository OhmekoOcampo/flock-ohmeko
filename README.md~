STILL HAVE NOT UPLOADED FINISHED TDD AND GDD YET TO BLACKBOARD. WILL FINISH TODAY. :)
VERSION CONTROL IS FUN WHEN YOU GET USE TO IT. HAHA.

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how PGC is done in Unity and 
how Perlin Noise and pseudo-random numbers are use to achieve it. In order to illustrate this
I have done a very simple Minecraft Clone just to illustrate this fact where having the player walk
around and the environment grow and shrink procedurally from where he/she is on the game map.

Due Date: 5 March 2017
Class: CS 596 Advance 3D Game Programming
Professor: Steve Price

Note: The reason why I ended up mass adding commits is because I didn't have this project under 
version control to begin with. Also this project is still in it's early stages. I'm still playing around
with the PGC and it proved to be tougher than it looks so this Minecraft Clone project is still a work
in progress. 

Note about the complexity analysis: I placed my attempt in analyzing the codes complexity in my TDD word document.

There is an issue with the one in Rijeka, please grade the one that is zipped up on blackboard. The joy stick controller does
not show up for some reason on the pushed version.
